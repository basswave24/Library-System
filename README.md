# Library System
 Library System where the user can search and reserve books from a database, as well as an Authentication System
# About
 I have created this project as part of my Web Development 2 module in Second Year. It was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP and mySQL. It allows the user to search a database for books, reserve any books as well as containing a User Authentication System.
# Feedback
I have received great feedback from the lecturer. I got a high mark for the assignment. If I was to do it again, I would try improve the php code readability as well as the CSS.
